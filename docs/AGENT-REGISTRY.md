# Agent Registry Protocol

Status: active local-registry protocol for multi-agent coordination

Use this file as the tracked specification for the local registry that tells agents how many agents are active and what role each one has.

The live registry file is local and gitignored:

- `.agent-local/agents.json`

Agents should read `.agent-local/agents.json` at the start of work to discover:

- how many agents are currently active
- each agent's `id`
- each agent's `role`
- each agent's current scope
- whether a peer agent is active, paused, or done

## Role Model

The system supports multiple concurrent agents, not just one `coding` and one `doc`.

Each agent entry must declare one role:

- `coding`
  owns issue resolution, feature work, local verification, commit/push flow, and CI checks after each push
- `doc`
  owns design-note sync, roadmap/checklist refresh, explanatory docs, and planning-surface wording; this role does not check CI by default

Any number of agents may share the same role, as long as they do not collide on the same issue or primary file set.

## Registry Shape

The local registry file must be valid JSON and use this top-level shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-03-11T00:00:00Z",
  "agent_count": 2,
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "agent-coding-1",
      "role": "coding",
      "status": "active",
      "scope": "#42 accepted-head strictness",
      "files": [
        "crates/mycel-core/src/verify.rs",
        "apps/mycel-cli/tests/object_verify_smoke.rs"
      ],
      "mailbox": ".agent-local/agent-coding-1.md"
    },
    {
      "id": "agent-doc-1",
      "role": "doc",
      "status": "active",
      "scope": "planning sync for #42",
      "files": [
        "ROADMAP.md",
        "IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.en.md"
      ],
      "mailbox": ".agent-local/agent-doc-1.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Required Fields

Top level:

- `version`
- `updated_at`
- `agent_count`
- `agents`

Per agent:

- `id`
- `role`
- `status`
- `scope`
- `files`
- `mailbox`

Allowed `role` values:

- `coding`
- `doc`

Allowed `status` values:

- `active`
- `paused`
- `blocked`
- `done`

`agent_count` must equal the number of entries in `agents`.

## Workflow

1. Before starting work, an agent reads `.agent-local/agents.json`.
2. The agent confirms the current agent count and scans the existing scopes and file sets.
3. The agent adds or updates its own entry before editing tracked files.
4. The agent uses its own `mailbox` file for peer coordination and handoff traffic.
5. When scope changes, the agent updates its registry entry.
6. When work is finished or paused, the agent updates `status`.

If two `coding` agents would touch the same primary file or issue, one must pause or choose a narrower scope before proceeding.

## Mailbox Rule

The registry tells agents who exists. Mailboxes carry the actual messages.

Recommended local mailbox pattern:

- `.agent-local/<agent-id>.md`

If a simpler shared mailbox flow is preferred, agents may still use:

- `.agent-local/coding-to-doc.md`
- `.agent-local/doc-to-coding.md`

The registry remains the source for current agent count and role assignment.

## Minimal Example

For one `coding` agent and one `doc` agent:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-03-11T00:00:00Z",
  "agent_count": 2,
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "coding-1",
      "role": "coding",
      "status": "active",
      "scope": "#17 store refactor",
      "files": [
        "apps/mycel-cli/src/store.rs",
        "apps/mycel-cli/src/store/index.rs"
      ],
      "mailbox": ".agent-local/coding-1.md"
    },
    {
      "id": "doc-1",
      "role": "doc",
      "status": "active",
      "scope": "planning sync for #17",
      "files": [
        "ROADMAP.md",
        "IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.en.md"
      ],
      "mailbox": ".agent-local/doc-1.md"
    }
  ]
}
```
